# Copilot

App Explanation. Exported Data Analysis Tools, Issues, Roadmap, and Collaboration for [Copilot](https://www.clayweidinger.com/copilot/)

## App Explanation

Copilot helps you collect and manage all the various inputs and todos you come across.

## Exported Data Analysis Tools

Since the data you enter is yours, the app has an export feature in the settings page. This export can enable you analyze your personal data. This repository houses Data Analysis Tools we've built to give you a headstart in understanding your own data. ()[] is a good place to start.

## Issues

If you find a bug in the App or the Data Analysis Tools, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/cweidinger/copilot/issues).

## Roadmap

We're committed to delivering usable functionality regularly. Checkout our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what you can expect. If you'd like to see a particular feature, raise an [issue](https://github.com/cweidinger/copilot/issues).

## Collaboration

### Pull Requests

Please keep changes small so they can be quickly accepted.

### Your Data's Schema

At Copilot, we thoroughly believe that the data you put into our app is yours and that you should have meaningful export access to it. In addition to the export functionality, the [schema](SCHEMA.md) will help you interpret your exported data if you'd like to import it into a different system or just analyze it yourself ;).
